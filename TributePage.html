          <p>Georges Henri Joseph Édouard Lemaître (17 July 1894 – 20 June 1966) was a Belgian Catholic Priest, astronomer and professor of physics at the Catholic University of Leuven.</p>
          <p>He proposed the theory of the expansion of the universe, widely misattributed to Edwin Hubble. He was the first to derive what is now known as Hubble's law and made the first estimation of what is now called the Hubble constant, which he published in 1927, two years before Hubble's article. Einstein was skeptical of this paper. When Lemaître approached Einstein at the 1927 Solvay Conference, the latter pointed out that Alexander Friedmann had proposed a similar solution to Einstein's equations in 1922, implying that the radius of the universe increased over time. </p>
          <p>Lemaître also proposed what became known as the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe, which he called his "hypothesis of the primeval atom" or the "Cosmic Egg". In January 1933, Lemaître and Einstein, who had met on three occasions—in 1927 in Brussels, at the time of a Solvay Conference, in 1932 in Belgium, at the time of a cycle of conferences in Brussels, and in 1935 at Princeton—traveled together to attend a series of seminars in California. After the Belgian detailed his theory, Einstein stood up, applauded, and is supposed to have said, "This is the most beautiful and satisfactory explanation of creation to which I have ever listened." However, there is disagreement over the reporting of this quote in the newspapers of the time, and it may be that Einstein was not actually referring to the theory as a whole but to Lemaître's proposal that cosmic rays may in fact be the leftover artifacts of the initial "explosion".</p>
          <p>In 1933, when he resumed his theory of the expanding universe and published a more detailed version in the Annals of the Scientific Society of Brussels, Lemaître achieved his greatest public recognition. Newspapers around the world called him a famous Belgian scientist and described him as the leader of the new cosmological physics.</p>

          <h4>Main facts:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>1894 - born on 17 July 1894 in Charleroi, Belgium</li>  
            <li>1914 - he interrupted his studies at the Collège du Sacré-Coeur in Charleroi, to serve as an artillery officer in the Belgian army for the duration of World War</li>
            <li>1920 - obtained his doctorate with a thesis entitled l'Approximation des fonctions de plusieurs variables réelles (Approximation of functions of several real variables), written under the direction of Charles de la Vallée-Poussin</li>
            <li>1923 - Lemaître was ordained a priest. Moreover, he became a graduate student in astronomy at the University of Cambridge, spending a year at St Edmund's House</li>
            <li>1925 - on his return to Belgium, he became a part-time lecturer at the Catholic University of Leuven</li>
            <li>1927 - famous publication under the title "A homogeneous Universe of constant mass and growing radius accounting for the radial velocity of extragalactic nebulae" - Annals of the Scientific Society of Brussels</li>
            <li>1931 - the article translated into English, but the part of it pertaining to the estimation of the "Hubble constant" was not included in the translation for reasons that have never been properly explained. The same year, Lemaître returned to MIT to present his doctoral thesis on The gravitational field in a fluid sphere of uniform invariant density according to the theory of relativity. Upon obtaining his Ph.D., he was named ordinary professor at the Catholic University of Leuven.</li>
            <li>1933 - when he resumed his theory of the expanding universe and published a more detailed version in the Annals of the Scientific Society of Brussels, Lemaître achieved his greatest public recognition.</li>
            <li>1936 - he was elected member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences</li>
            <li>1941 - he was elected a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences and Arts of Belgium</li>
            <li>1946 - he published his book on L'Hypothèse de l'Atome Primitif (The Primeval Atom Hypothesis</li>
            <li>1951 - Pope Pius XII declared that Lemaître's theory provided a scientific validation for Catholicism. However, Lemaître resented the Pope's proclamation, stating that the theory was neutral and there was neither a connection nor a contradiction between his religion and his theory</li>
            <li>1966 - He died on 20 June, shortly after having learned of the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation, which provided further evidence for his proposal about the birth of the universe.</li>
